credit versions next time since the credit text really is part of the experience  a lot of people only knew of jojo s from part 3 back in the day  so i m really happy that the people in this rewatch can enjoy the extra power of all the dio hype though it s clearly written so that new viewers do nt need to go back to get why he s a threat nobody in this episode besides dio himself ever bore witness to the events of part 1  so the way they treat him as a nighmythical charismatic monster fits in the show and outside as well  it s great that holly is nt your stereotypical anime mom in design  she really does look like a woman old enough to have jotaro for a son  and her inner youth accentuates that rather than overrides it she s the kind of person who does nt deserve what s happening to her  and that s part of why her illness works as the impetus for the quest to find and kill dio  while i m at it   irrefutable proof that joseph does nt actually know how his own stand

making this post to clarify a couple things and highlight our rules  which are as follows  1   please read the  skyrim faq   https  wwwredditcomrskyrimwikiindex  before you post    this is a good way to start the faq outlines several commonly asked questions and also highlights certain threads that contain good information  such as  what mods should i get   and system info  among other things  2   slurs and personal attacks will be met with an immediate ban    anything that can be construed as a personal attack or slur  even in jest  is not allowed in skyrim  in the last hour  i ve banned 10 people   http  iimgurcomvoxjgoepng  for varying degrees of personal attacks  and it s easy for me  because all i have to do it press a button and then read someone telling me to go life myself we have 4 pages of bans  and i do nt mind adding to it  so behave yourselves and if you see someone telling someone else to kill themselves or something similar  report it  3   mods reserve the right to remove posts and ban users at their discretion    see rule 2  4   no memes  no rage comics  no unrelated material    the first two are self explanatory instead  i will be explaining what constitutes unrelated material   pictures of real life that remind you of skyrim   hand prints   anything that is nt a screenshot of skyrim  art someone made of skyrim  or direct cosplay  including crafts  from skyrim   sweetrolls   screenshots or images with memelike text or captions   piracy  where to pirate the game  etc   begging for someone to gift you the game go life off   etc   on the topic of reposts    get over it there are 316379 subscribed users on rskyrim  and if rpics  user count of 9942242 subscribers is any indication of how many people are registered on this site  that means that only 318  of all of reddit normally sees posts on rskyrim  and i highly doubt that all 316379 of you see every single post made here  if anyone has questions or wants to get banned  please say

dominion  takes place in the entire aldmeri dominion main plots would involve the build up for the next great war and the imperial attempts to sabotage the military build up may take place concurrently or shortly after skyrim  with only vague references to the  troubles in skyrim  importantly the goals and ideologies of the members of the dominion would be presented in a positive light  with emphasis on how everybody is actually pretty happy  and the economy seems to be booming of course there will be drawbacks  like some racism and maybe the occasional secret police raids  but most common citizens will feel that it s worth it of course the imperial agents  maybe some of them blades or penitus oculatus  will be shown as cutthroat  paranoid agents who will sacrifice anything to achieve their goals  there would be a quest line to combat the imperials or to help sabotage the dominion  though you may be able to do both  the thieves guild may be based in elsweyr  the fighters guild could be a mercenary group that is taking care of policing while the army prepares for war  the mages guild could be a research lab for the war effort  or just a regular college  the assassins guild could be made up of some surviving dark brotherhood members  maybe even some that were presumed dead by cicero  important mechanics would be in game consequences for your actions oh  you helped imperial agents destroy the mill  now the khajit that ran the place is in the street begging for money because he ca nt afford the repairs oh  killed the spy that was bothering that shopkeeper  now she ll happily sell you better goods at lower prices  or maybe offer an alternative solution to a tricky quest oh  you did nt kill the thief that you caught while on patrol with the mercenaries  every bandit hideout now has an extra enemy for a few days oh  you  did  kill that thief  now the thieves guild thinks they ve been crossed and wants you to find out who s betraying them  in this game you

show should start 100 years after the end of tng this way meaningful references can be made to prior shows and it would nt feel like a totally different universe  3  the ship should be the enterprise assuming that after tng there were 2 other enterprises this show will start on the 3rd enterprise following tng  4  the captain should be a black earth woman  with a strong moral center  5  the first officer should be a human male with a  trip  type personality from the enterprise show probably from the american south  somewhere like louisiana  6  the science officer should be a female vulcan  7  there should be a new generation of male datatype droid on the crew as one of the helmsmen  8  one of the other main helmsmen should be a female andorian  9  the tactical officer should be a japanese male  with strong cultural ties to ancient samurai  10  the ship counselor should be something like a male yogi  or a buddhist type personality  11  the chief medical officer should be a female cardassian  with a male human assistant a human emh program should make periodical appearances also  12  the chief engineer should be a russian male  get an actual russian actor who speaks fluent english    the universe since tng  ds9  discarding all the extended universe  wiki stuff  a la star wars   1  cardassia has joined the federation after it s destruction at the end of ds9 they have committed to rebuilding their society as a peaceful  antiwar civilization  2  after their ruin while fighting the dominian war  the klingon empire has struggled to rebuild they committed to a huge armament buildup program and since ds9 have been fighting to regain their honor they are seen throughout the federation as  once mighty warriors  who have lost everything 3  the neutral zone with the romulans still exists and the political situation with the romulans is unchanged since the end of ds9 although the romulans have been slowly expanding on the other side of the neutral zone into new territory the romulans have also formed a temporary alliance with the tholians to fight the klingons in total war of destruction against the klingons the klingons retain most of their territory and are going through a lot of  soul searching   4  the breen have begun active expansion into the gamma quadrant 5  the borg are having difficulty retaking lost territory after their collective was almost destroyed at the end of voyager the borg has developed internal factions fighting for freedom they are not as strong as they once were  but they are nastier and more ruthless than before  6  the gamma and delta quadrants are still largely unexplored  7  after all the conflicts ended with tng and ds9  federation citizens desired an era of peace  which has lasted 100 years so far  something akin to  pax romana  has been taking place for federation citizens  exploration has come to mean conflict and making new enemies and running into trouble  they are simply tired of conflict an isolationist mentality has spread through the land the spirit of starfleet has dimmed there is little political support to help the klingons in their war for survival  but because of the alliance  starfleet must commit at least a minimum of support federation citizens have become apathetic  complacent  lethargic and unmotivated joining starfleet means nothing anymore in the complacency  enemies of the federation have started slowly infiltrating the society  attempting to deteriorate it from the inside by encouraging corruption  petty disputes  political rivalries and a dumbing down of society in general the enemies of the federation are clearly engaged in a secretive divide and conquer strategy   the show  each season would have an overarching theme and title  which would appear next to the episode name  season 1 title should be something like   we were explorers once  the premise  the new starfleet president feels passionately that starfleet needs to be reenergized with a new mission the complacency must end the new enterprise and several other flagships are sent on highly publicized missions of exploration into the gamma quadrant through the bajoran wormhole this new exploration initiative is an attempt to reignite a feeling of nostalgia in federation citizens  a way back to the way things were long ago starfleet calls this the  new frontier project   the isolationists are disturbed by this and protests erupt  even sabotage is attempted the enterprise encounters more nonhumanoid species than humanoids  but most of them are not so warm towards humanoids the enterprise does not understand why all the discrimination against humanoids  season 2 title should be something like   the values we hold dear  the premise  the enterprise is still deep in the gamma quadrant exploring but there is increasing political turmoil back home inside the federation being immune from the happenings back home  the enterprise continues on its interesting mission  but ca nt help being pulled into the political drama once in a while  even being as far away as the gamma quadrant with the help of new  microwormhole detection technology   the crew of the enterprise can make visits to the alpha quadrant in a shuttle pod only once a stable microwormhole is detected meanwhile  while continuing to explore the gamma quadrant  the enterprise continues to find that the gamma quadrant is filled more with nonhumanoid races than humanoids the enterprise discovers that in the gamma quadrant the few humanoid races have created a xenophobic alliance of sorts and discriminate against nonhumanoids nonhumanoids see the humanoids as isolated  scared  angry and primitive  season 3 title should be something like   civil war  the premise  a large splinter faction is seceding from the federation  similar to the american civil war the enterprise must take a side and help to put an end to the conflict in some way battles worthy of  song and story  appear in this season this is one of the darkest hours of the federation since it s beginning in some way  the klingons and romulans are part of this  season 4 title should be something like   fortune favors the bold  the premise  with the civil war ended  the people of the federation have reignited their soul and realized that they either move into the future together  boldly and united  or the entire experiment falls to pieces the people realize that the federation is the only thing preventing the galaxy from plunging into the dark ages of endless territorial wars a new spirit of exploration and peacekeeping is born from the ashes of the destruction at home in a symbol of unity  half of the enterprise crew is replaced with personnel from the former opposing faction the enterprise enters the gamma quadrant  this time  from the other side to explore new territory  and not through the bajoran wormhole the enterprise is having a hard time finding friends in nonhumanoid races due to the prejudice which exists in the gamma quadrant the enterprise decides it s up to them to forge new alliances with nonhumanoids and to break old prejudices  season 5 would be all about exploration with no interruption from federation political drama this season would include an appearance from the borg for the first time  season 6  7 would go from there  a show like this would give us a good mix of exploration  political drama  war  and most importantly the constant testing of federation morals and

we can formulate the equations in a way which technically agrees exactly with gravitational experiment this is particularly applies to the timing of gps systems here we also present the generic formulae for time dilation  which allow these equations to be used in instances including that of black hole gravitational systems here we further show  in extreme cases such as at the schwarzschild radius of black holes  these dynamic advanced equations can be applied to gravitational time dilation equation  9   indicates that time dilation at the schwarzschild radius  where time is slowed  is not infinitely slowed but slows by a factor of 15 thus  using this eq  9   in the dnag model the time dilation is not infinite  and does not result in a black hole singularity  in previous publications we have already calculated the advance in the perihelion of mercury and other planets and astronomical objects in the solar system  to a very high degree of accuracy  3   a reformulation of the equations shows that advanced gravitational equations are also very accurate for binary pulsars  using recent data for psr b 153412 from straumann  6  7   here  it has also been shown that theses equations are accurate for observations of cygnus x1  1214   these results suggest a straight line correlation between dynamic advanced gravitation  for low and medium mass and high density gravitational bodies  these dynamic advanced equations  can also help explain the apparent missing mass of the galaxy  due to the presence of  primordial  black holes in the galactic halo  1  2   and

be a distinct pathological trait that manifests in different ways  unsurprising considering the complexity of the average personality  i ve known a few people with varying degrees of narcissism over the years  and narcissists who are dissatisfied with themselves definitely exist  and can be the most sneaky and toxic narcissists who are grandiose tend to be very obvious and easy to handleavoid narcissists with low selfesteem tend to be very sneaky  because you re expecting a bold personality and lots of bragging the reason they re still narcissists is because despite not believing highly of themselves  they have an unhealthily excessive preoccupation with themselves  and unhealthy attachment to others  viewing them as objects of praise   a lack of true empathy  they may display it frequently  but if you dig a little it will be revealed that they demonstrate it simply when they believe it is expected of them  is also key to their

composition it may differ from the final official version of record  11 in low and medium gravitational fields the results of current classical models and dynamic gravity presented here are technically exactly the same  see results 31   notably  in both gravitational models time dilation increase significantly as the radius of orbit approaches 10 schwarzschild radii or less at these distances the results still remain almost the same current classical gravity gives a time dilation factor of 105  compared to 1054 in dynamic advanced gravity at 10 rs however  in classical gravity time dilation increases exponentially as we approach the event horizon  and time stops at the event horizon with advanced gravity in the case where the event horizon has been reached at 1rs  time dilation due to gravity is equivalent to a factor of 15  eq  9    importantly  the presumed singularities that appeared in current gravity do not appear in these dynamic advanced equations  these observations are strongly corroborated by a reanalysis of recent observations from black holes these observations include emissions from the radius of innermost stable circular orbit  risco   12   and broadening of the iron k alpha line  13   from the observations of cygnus x 1  the results give an inner radius rin  112 rs  and xray fluorescence was shown to be predominantly confined to 10 rs  12   observations of cygnus x1 spectra and the iron k alpha line  gives a red shift 081 101 2  red    13   current classical gravity  eq  1    predicts an increase by a factor of 3055 in the gravitational red shift at the radius of 112 rs  with a red shift 191 2  red   thus  the results from classical gravity predict almost twice the observed values here we predict gravitation red shift by a factor of 1446  at 112 rs  with a red shift  1 013 2  red   in keeping with recent observations  13   importantly these equations allow further accurate tests of gravitation  particularly in the vicinity of black holes  page 11 of 14 can j phys downloaded from wwwnrcresearchpresscom by san diego  ucsd  on 122915 for personal use only this justin manuscript is the accepted manuscript prior to copy editing

we can formulate the equations in a way which technically agrees exactly with gravitational experiment this is particularly applies to the timing of gps systems here we also present the generic formulae for time dilation  which allow these equations to be used in instances including that of black hole gravitational systems here we further show  in extreme cases such as at the schwarzschild radius of black holes  these dynamic advanced equations can be applied to gravitational time dilation equation  9   indicates that time dilation at the schwarzschild radius  where time is slowed  is not infinitely slowed but slows by a factor of 15 thus  using this eq  9   in the dnag model the time dilation is not infinite  and does not result in a black hole singularity  in previous publications we have already calculated the advance in the perihelion of mercury and other planets and astronomical objects in the solar system  to a very high degree of accuracy  3   a reformulation of the equations shows that advanced gravitational equations are also very accurate for binary pulsars  using recent data for psr b 153412 from straumann  6  7   here  it has also been shown that theses equations are accurate for observations of cygnus x1  1214   these results suggest a straight line correlation between dynamic advanced gravitation  for low and medium mass and high density gravitational bodies  these dynamic advanced equations  can also help explain the apparent missing mass of the galaxy  due to the presence of  primordial  black holes in the galactic halo  1  2   and to the indirect effects that an increased force of gravity has on the galactic rotation curve dynamic advanced gravity can explain the presence of page 12 of 14 can j phys downloaded from

official version of record  13 dark matter at the galactic level because of an increase in gravity that is predicted  but goes beyond this in the prediction of observations from the bullet cluster  2  3   in this paper  it has been demonstrated that dynamic advanced gravity can also explain the physical phenomena of time dilation  and technically agrees accurately with gravitational experiment it explains the recent findings of increased gamma rays emanating from the supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy  15   by resolving infinite time dilation it also resolves the difficulties that arise from the formation of infinite density singularities overall  dynamic newtonian advanced gravity  dnag   de facto technically gives exactly the same answers as gravitational experiment  but it is also offers a solution to a number of contemporary gravitational anomalies  importantly it offers a number of verifiable predictions for gravity  particularly in the vicinity of black holes this could be achieved in accordance with the results of the generic equations for black hole as given in table 1 gravitational time dilation could either be measured the using the gravitational red shift of a strong em source in the vicinity of a black hole equally well a probe issuing a timed signal could be used significant differences between dnag and classical gravity would emerge at about 10

take this family by family  edit  fyi rickard was ned s father  not rodrick starks  sansa  arya  bran  rickon  jon     and jeyne  robb s wife  is pregnant if i m not mistaken this is the main protaganist family and at the very least i expect sansa  bran  as a tree   and rickon to live through our story so their line can continue  tully  the blackfish and edmure are alive and i expect edmure to live why would the freys kill him when they married him into the family blackfish is childless and unmarried but that can change  arryn  this is the one family i do think is probably gon na get wiped out do nt see sweet robin making it harold hardyng is a decedent of the arryn line and he may yet survive but he does nt have the arryn name  baratheon  we know gendry and edric are both still alive i m sure there are other unknown bastards as well all they need is legitimization and i ll add that stannis is nt book dead  and is like the only death ever not shown on tv show deaths tend to be very graphic as soon as it cut away i was like  damn  brienne decided not to do it   so there s a chance he still lives  tyrells  lot of tyrells left mace has like 4 kids  all of whom are still alive if i m not mistaken i do expect mace to die though mace also had a sister marry into the redwynes there is plenty of opportunity for the tyrells to come out of this with the line intact  martells  arianne and trystane are still alive and oberyn has a ton of sand snakes just takes someone to legitimize one of them and the martells are the one family who allows a woman to rule i think they are probably the safest  even if arianne and trystane die  lannisters  kevan lannister has 3 living children if i m not mistaken lancel  prolly dies   martyn  given back by robb stark   and janei the youngest tywin also had a sister named genna who is currently married into house frey i tend to think at minimum martyn lives  targs  dany will make it to the last book but might not live  jon snow     and faegon targs have a high probability of being wiped out  especially if jon and aegon are nt targs  greyjoys  theon  asha  euron  victarion  and aeron at minimum theon has no cock so forget him the uncles are all childless as far as i know i think asha will survive though may be the first women to rule the iron islands if i made any mistakes please let me

wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax

versions next time since the credit text really is part of the experience  a lot of people only knew of jojo s from part 3 back in the day  so i m really happy that the people in this rewatch can enjoy the extra power of all the dio hype though it s clearly written so that new viewers do nt need to go back to get why he s a threat nobody in this episode besides dio himself ever bore witness to the events of part 1  so the way they treat him as a nighmythical charismatic monster fits in the show and outside as well  it s great that holly is nt your stereotypical anime mom in design  she really does look like a woman old enough to have jotaro for a son  and her inner youth accentuates that rather than overrides it she s the kind of person who does nt deserve what s happening to her  and that s part of why her illness works as the impetus for the quest to find and kill dio  while i m at it   irrefutable proof that joseph does nt actually know how his own stand works   https

of wealth storage  a means of demonstrating success  etc this can be fixed by using specific currencies for specific things  a saving currency  a trading currency  an investment currency  etc make tax

show  but there is a lot of shit in this show that drives me bananas just like this   nobody ever wears any kind of armor just a leather jacket would give  some  sort of protection from bites and most of the time when people get bit its on the arm  and while they re doing something stupid like tyrese  he was just staring at a picture on the wall  i assume thinking  twins  twins  twins  what does it mean  twins there are 2 of them   at which time he gets bit on the arm at this point they should be clearing areas  armed and with proper armor  before they go sightseeing   they  should  be trying to be quiet when the zeds are close  but instead have entire conversations when they re  right in the middle of a lifeing horde of zombies   and rick is the loudest of them all   and if zombie guts covered clothing makes them virtually invisible to the zeds  then why are nt they calmly slaying them by the hundred wearing zombie guts covered armor and using spears   somehow  the second someone becomes a zombie in this show  their skull turns into paper mach  and you can just easily slide a knife in there and magically hit that  one spot  that turns them off like a light switch people who die and return as a zombie 2 minutes later are also somehow rotten and their clothing is automatically all lifeed up   this show is based on the romero zombie moviesworld  and in those movies  zombies  like everything on this planet  are  afraid  of fire but in this show  and seemingly only when they need it to the zombies are attracted to fire and will stupidly just walk right into it and stand there until they burn up   it s been several years since the apocalypse has taken over  yet every time they find a vehicle is miraculously full of good gasoline and the keys are in the ignition   daryl dixon rides the loudest vehicle you can find  to be a stealthy tracking ranger type with a silent crossbow   everyone is a headshot master  whether they ve ever held a gun before or not   no one ever uses any spears    that baby should be dead   all guns have unlimited ammo until the plot demands them to be out   people put themselves in dangerous situations that there is absolutely no reason

depends on what you are into anything can be dangerous or safe  it all depends on how much attention and effort you are putting into it  for example  i know a couple of guys that are into modding their bikes for power and doing roll ons  and they will meticulously check tire pressure  replace wheel bearings  check their forks  safety wire fairings  and only go out late at night at like 34 am to do pulls on the highways always full leathers  always scouting runs  likewise  i know guys that commute most year around on their bmw adventure bikes  and they are very aware of things like slowing down for intersections  staying away from cars  and general street strategy  the guys that end up getting hurt or killed are the ones that approach riding without much thought  whether on the street or on the track  or in the woods on dirt bikes  just be aware that going fast on the track takes a bit of investment in both time and finances it takes a good amount of training to go fast around corners  as well as money for things like good tires  and other bike specific things likewise  unless you are on a separate track bike  you will always be holding back and not developing as much skill as you should because you wo nt want to wreck it and because that bike wo nt be street legal  you need some way to transport the bike  and generally  riding to the track is a bad idea</td><td>d020srv</td><td>lifestyle</td><td>1.45564032E9</td><td>skillsxr600</td><td>1.0</td><td>0.0</td><td>139.0</td><td>4224.0</td><td>false</td><td>motorcycles</td></tr><tr><td>lol about 6

ride dual sports  drz400  wr250x  and currently have an 899 panigale it s definitely a different experience but if you re willing to adapt and learn a new philosophy then you may just love it a sport bike does nt have the height of a ds and the balance is totally different with a ds your waist is like a joint between the man and the machine  it pivots and moves often counter to the bike part of this is low speed handling dynamics a sport bike is meant to do three things  go like hell  stop like hell and teach you gyroscopic physics while turning  you may need to change your approach to this bike it s all about weighting the front or rear tire as necessary and playing q game of chicken in the turns when you re accelerating keep your balls on the tank and your face in the fairing when you re slowing put your ass on the pillion and use your thighs and abdominal muscles to keep your shoulders perpendicular to the ground when turning use the outside thigh as a primary connection to the bike as best as possible keep your wrists light and feathery  riding a sport bike is a discipline  like yoga it can in a certain sense be relaxing but it can also be physically demanding if you re looking for a leisurely stroll you came for the wrong

brief review of the canik tp9sf  the newest gun in the tp9 series the tp9sf improves on the tp9sa  which has been called the best budget 9mm by many reviewers  by removing the controversial decocker and adding industry standard sight dovetail cuts  mamp  p front  glock rear   among some other minor changes i got this one for  368 shipped and aim surplus had them last week for  349 shipped  so these guns continue to be very affordable  let s get the bad out of the way  my particular gun did not run right i started noticing intermittent failure to fires towards the tail end of the first box of ammo the gun would release the striker  but it was not hitting the primer after the second box  the gun was failing to fire nearly every shot unless the trigger was released all the way the problem ended up being that the trigger bar was slipping off to the side of the firing pin block plunger instead of lifting it up and out of the way this would only happen with live fire  not when racking the slide manually  so it was a pain debug after finding the problem though  it was easy to remedy i simply bent the trigger bar nub that interfaces with the fpb slightly and now the gun has been 100  after about another 200 rounds  i sort of give canik a pass on this since the gun was probably working fine at the factory and did nt start acting up until the parts started wearing in a little  so qc testing would nt have seen it this part of the gun should be unchanged from the tp9sa  and really the p99 that the system was copied from  and i have nt heard of this issue through much googling i would chalk this up to a one off issue on my particular gun unless reports of this issue start popping up  i have pretty bad luck when it comes to this kind of thing   aside from that issue  i ve been really enjoying the gun the trigger is as good as advertised  extremely crisp break and short  distinct reset it makes the practical accuracy of this gun very good  i was surprised how accurately i could shoot this gun offhand and how effortless it was to just put the sight on the target and make the gun go bang the tight lock up of the barrel and slide give this gun good mechanical accuracy as well i did nt do a formal test  but shooting off a rest at 10 yards i was getting 15  groups without trying that hard  the gun also gets high marks on ergonomics  at least in my fairly average sized hands the grip shape is comfortable and points naturally  the stippling on the grip panels and the stubble on the front and rear straps are grippy but do nt bite into the hands the mag and slide release are located where i can get to them without shifting my shooting grip  and the trigger reach is comfortable for me for larger handed people  there s a large backstrap you can swap in  overall  i am quite pleased with this gun once i got the issue ironed out obviously  the jury is still out on long term durability  particularly if my  fix  holds up over a few thousand rounds the track record of the tp9sa has been pretty positive though  so i m hoping for good things for this model as well all i can say at this point is that the gun is very enjoyable and easy to shoot and quite the bargain

surprisingly large amount of characters in the film and feel like we could have used a few more moments with each of them  though the run time is already at pretty much two hours  2nd edit  actually ended up seeing it a second time with different friends noticed vanessa is wearing wade s coat when she gets kidnapped from when he is threatening the
